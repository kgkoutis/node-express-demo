## Simple express demo app

(Disclaimer):
This repos essentially follows the instructions of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE) and is very similar to [this repository](https://github.com/bradtraversy/express_crash_course) from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy), I merely added my personal notes here for clarification

node\_modules:
+ express (duh!)
+ nodemon \- restart the server automatically
+ path: \- path manipulation
+ moment: \- date and time formatting
+ uuid: \- simulates the generation of unique id of a database
+ express-handlebars: \- a view template rendering engine 

To run the scripts in the "package.json" file
```bash
  npm run start (production mode)
  ```
or
```bash
  npm run dev (development mode)
  ```
of course, for production mode, you can simply run
```bash
node index.js
```
